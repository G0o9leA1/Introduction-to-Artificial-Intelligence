# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
It is based on CS188 at UC Berkeley.

## Project 1: General search algorithms
### Goals
Help Pacman agent to find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.

1. Depth-first search (DFS)
2. Breadth-first search (BFS)
3. Uniform-cost graph search
4. A* graph search
5. Implement a search problem *CornersProblem*
6. Implement a consistent, non-trivial heuristic for *CornersProblem*
7. Implement a consistent, non-trivial heuristic for *FoodSearchProblem*
8. Suboptimal search

## Project 2: Adversarial search
### Goals
Design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts.

1. Reflex agent
2. Minimax agent
3. Alpha-beta pruning
4. Expectimax agent
5. Better evaluation function

## Project 3: Reinforcement learning

## Project 4: Probabilistic inference
